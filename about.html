    <P>The journey to founding the Pizza Parlor began in the quiet moments of personal struggle for Chef Lorenda R. Cheeks. For years, she battled unexplained inflammation and stiffness in her joints—pains that no physician could explain. Frustrated but determined, Lorenda turned inward and began researching her symptoms herself. Her search led her to Eat Right for Your Blood Type by Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo, where she first learned about tailoring nutrition to one’s genetics. Believing she was blood type A, she adopted a plant-based diet and, to her surprise, began to feel remarkably better. Encouraged by the results, she sought confirmation of her blood type—only to discover she was actually O-positive. Switching to the O-positive diet, which included animal proteins, she quickly noticed the return of her symptoms. That moment of clarity taught her something deeper than any diet—her body thrives when she listens to it, even if it defies expectations. <br/><br/>

    The wellness she experienced on a plant-based diet stayed with her, even as life took another turn. On February 24, 2023, Lorenda received a diagnosis that would challenge her very will to live: Stage 3 breast cancer. But in this moment of fear, something powerful ignited within her—hope. She leaned on her faith, her family, and the quiet strength that had carried her through years of pain. Food had always been her comfort, her language, her art. Now, it became her therapy and her weapon in the fight for her life. During her recovery, Chef Cheeks began experimenting in the kitchen, creating plant-based recipes that were not only nourishing but deeply satisfying. Out of these experiments came a dream—one that could nourish others while sharing her story of resilience. <br/><br/>
    
    From this crucible of pain and perseverance, the Pizza Parlor was born—not just as a restaurant, but as a sanctuary of healing and hope. Every slice served is a celebration of life, a reminder that even in the face of diagnosis and uncertainty, joy can still rise like dough in a warm oven. The Pizza Parlor offers a unique twist on traditional comfort food, with a menu inspired by plant-based ingredients, health-conscious choices, and Chef Cheeks' journey toward healing. It is more than a business—it is a tribute to the human spirit, to listening to one's body, and to never giving up. For Chef Lorenda R. Cheeks, the Pizza Parlor stands as a beacon of what’s possible when pain meets purpose, and when faith is folded into every bite.</P>
